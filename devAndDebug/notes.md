## Global Features vs Core Modules vs Third Party Modules

You can basically differentiate between:
    * **Global Features**: Keywords like const or funtion but also some global objects
    * **Core Node.js Modules**: Examples would be the file-system module("fs"), the path module("path)
    * **Third Party Modules**: Installed via npm install - you can add any kind of feature to your app

<br>

**Global features** are **always available** you dont need to import them into files where you want to use them

<br>

**Core Node.js Modules** dont need to be installled but you do need to **import them** when you want to use features exposed by them



## Types of Errors

* Syntax Errors

* Runtime Errors
    * Try to execute some code where it breaks when it runs

* Logical Errors
    * Behavior is not working like it should
